## About
We investigate the transformability of dynamics on higher-order networks, focusing on how contagion processes can be transformed across different network representations. By systematically analyzing these dynamics, we identify the underlying criteria that govern the transformation of dynamics across diverse network structures. Building on these insights, we propose a general framework to to characterize and capture the transformation of dynamical behavior from higher-order networks to their pairwise graph counterparts. We further demonstrate the robustness and applicability of this framework in different types of dynamics, highlighting its potential for understanding and controlling complex collective behaviors.

## About File


The repository contains two main folders. The code folder provides implementations for simulations and the associated data structures. For the purposes of further studies, we have provided the core codes for data management and data structures, along with several illustrative toy implementations, and with additional codes to be released in the near future. The data folder includes the empirical higher-order networks used in this study.
